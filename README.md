# Snake Game (Pygame)

## Description
This is a simple yet classic Snake game implemented using Python's Pygame library. The game features smooth snake movement, boundary detection, food spawning, and score tracking. The snake's length increases as it eats food, and the game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.

## Features
- Realistic snake movement with smooth curves.
- Snake grows in length as it consumes food.
- Score and high score display.
- Game over screen with options to restart or quit.
- Boundaries to separate score and game field.
- Food respawns after being eaten.

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- Eat the blue food squares to increase your score and grow the snake.
- Avoid running into the screen edges or the snake itself.
- The game ends when you hit an obstacle, and your score is displayed.
